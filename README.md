# Geocoder
geocoder project for Python ver. 1.0

This code was designed to georeference a scrapped dataframe with several errors in the address line (Av. Washington, George, xxxx).

The Google API had errors when I was running the code, so I changed the layout to detect exactly where we have problems in the address line.
